# Future Improvements

This is a list of features that I would like to add to this project in the future.

-   [ ] Improve front end UX (lower task width, cleanup modals, etc)
-   [ ] Improve front end UI (better drag animation, cleaner colors, etc)
-   [ ] Refactor front end (smaller files, reuse code blocks)
-   [ ] Cleaner error responses from API. E.g. user already exists instead of generic responses
-   [ ] Add toast for confirmations
-   [ ] Audit security (users should only be able to access their data) - use sessions, might affect tests
-   [x] Add a test database
-   [ ] Cleanup and complete tests for all endpoints
-   [ ] Replace console.log with logger for better logging
-   [ ] Github actions to run tests/ check linting on push
-   [ ] Update tasks sort order should be sequential (no skipping)
-   [ ] Use NEST JS for scaling (big upgrade)
